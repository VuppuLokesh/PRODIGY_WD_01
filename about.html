        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p style=>

            Welcome to The Blue Monkey, where fashion meets individuality. We believe that clothing is not just about
            style; it's a form of self-expression, a way to convey your unique identity to the world.
        </p>

        <h2> Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Established in 1987, The Blu Monkey was born out of a passion for creating apparel that goes beyond
            trends. Our journey began with a simple idea: to provide fashion enthusiasts with clothing that mirrors
            their personality and empowers them to be confidently themselves.
        </p>
